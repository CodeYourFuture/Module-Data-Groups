// Predict and explain first...

// This program attempts to log out all the property values in the object.
// But it isn't working. Explain why first and then fix the problem

const author = {
  firstName: "Zadie",
  lastName: "Smith",
  occupation: "writer",
  age: 40,
  alive: true,
};

for (const value in author) {
  console.log(value);
}
// for...of works only with iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps..etc. In order to fix this problem we can use "for...in" to loop through the keys of the object.
