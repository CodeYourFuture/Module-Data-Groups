// Predict and explain first...

//This code tries to use a for...of loop on an object, but objects are not iterable by default.
//for...of works on iterables like arrays, strings, maps, sets â€” not plain objects.
//Running this will throw:
//TypeError: author is not iterable

// This program attempts to log out all the property values in the object.
// But it isn't working. Explain why first and then fix the problem
