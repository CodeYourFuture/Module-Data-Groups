// Predict and explain first...

// This code should log out the houseNumber from the address object
// but it isn't working...
// Fix anything that isn't working

// The code is trying to log the `houseNumber` property from the `address` object.
// However, the `address` object is not defined in the provided code snippet.
// To fix this, we need to define the `address` object first and then log the
// `houseNumber` property correctly.
// The code is also using a template literal to log the value, which is correct.
// Let's define the `address` object and log the `houseNumber` property.
const address = {
  houseNumber: 42,
  street: "Imaginary Road",
  city: "Manchester",
  country: "England",
  postcode: "XYZ 123",
};

console.log(`My house number is ${address.houseNumber}`);
