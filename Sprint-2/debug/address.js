// Predict and explain first...

 // address is an object, so we can't access it by address[0] like in array we need to use a notation
// address.houseNumber, address.street, address.city etc ...

// This code should log out the houseNumber from the address object
// but it isn't working...
// Fix anything that isn't working

const address = {
  houseNumber: 42,
  street: "Imaginary Road",
  city: "Manchester",
  country: "England",
  postcode: "XYZ 123",
};


console.log(`My house number is ${address.houseNumber}`);



// Address.js log function corrected
