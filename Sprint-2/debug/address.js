// Predict and explain first...

// This code should log out the houseNumber from the address object

// Fix anything that isn't working

// When we use a Object and we want to extract any of the elements we don't refers them like a array [0] (position)
// We can use the name of the object and follow the dot and the name of the element, with that we can extract the 
// value of the element
