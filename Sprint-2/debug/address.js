// Predict and explain first...

// This code should log out the houseNumber from the address object

// Fix anything that isn't working

const address = {
  houseNumber: 42,
  street: "Imaginary Road",
  city: "Manchester",
  country: "England",
  postcode: "XYZ 123",
};

console.log(`My house number is ${address.houseNumber}`);

//address is an object without a key, therefore address[0] is undefined. To fix this we write "address.houseNumber".
