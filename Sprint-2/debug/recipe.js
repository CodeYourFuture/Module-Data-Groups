// Predict and explain first...

// This program should log out the title, how many it serves and the ingredients.
// Each ingredient should be logged on a new line
// How can you fix it?

const recipe = {
  title: "bruschetta",
  serves: 2,
  ingredients: ["olive oil", "tomatoes", "salt", "pepper"],
};

console.log(`${recipe.title} serves ${recipe.serves}
  ingredients:
${recipe.ingredients.join(", ")}`);


// I guess, because the values of ingredients are given as array, 
// the way ingredients is passed to the log is not right.   

// recipe.js log function corrected.
