# 🧭 Guide to Sprint 2 exercises

This README will guide you through the different sections for this sprint.

## Setup

Make sure your terminal is in the `Sprint-2` directory of this repository.

Run the command `npm install` to install any dependencies you need.

## 🐛 Debug

Each of the files in `debug` contains a 🐛. Predict and explain first and then run the code with node to check your prediction. Fix any bugs that appear in the code.

## 🔨 Implement

In this section, you will have a short set of requirements about a function. You will need to implement a function based off this set of requirements. Make sure you check your function works for a number of different inputs.

Here is a recommended order:

1. `contains.test.js`
2. `lookup.test.js`
3. `tally.test.js`
4. `querystring.test.js`

## Interpret

In these tasks, you have to interpret a slightly larger program with some syntax / operators / functions that may be unfamiliar.
You must use documentation to make sense of anything unfamiliar - learning how to look things up this way is a fundamental part of being a developer!
You can also use `console.log` to check the value of different variables in the code.

Once you've completed all these tasks, raise a PR with your work so far. Don't wait to complete your coursework before completing the PR.

## Stretch 💪

Try the stretch tasks after you've completed the other sections.
