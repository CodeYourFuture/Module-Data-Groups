# 🧭 Guide to Week 2 exercises

This README will guide you through the different sections for this week.

## Setup

Go to the **root of this repository**. Double check you're there with `pwd`. Also double check with `ls`.
**If you're in the root you should be able to see the `week-1`, `week-2` and `week-3` directories**

Run the command `npm install` in the root of this repo.

To run tests in the `week-2` directory you can:

1. Change directory into `week-2`
2. Run the tests using `npm test`

## 🐛 Debug

Each of the files in `debug` contains a 🐛. Predict and explain first and then run the code with node to check your prediction. Fix any bugs that appear in the code.

## 🔨 Implement

In this section, you will have a short set of requirements about a function. You will need to implement a function based off this set of requirements. Make sure you check your function works for a number of different inputs.

Here is a recommended order:

1. `contains.test.js`
2. `lookup.test.js`
3. `tally.test.js`

## Interpret

In these tasks, you have to interpret a slightly larger program with some syntax / operators / functions that may be unfamiliar.
You must use documentation to make sense of anything unfamiliar - learning how to look things up this way is a fundamental part of being a developer!
You can also use `console.log` to check the value of different variables in the code.

Once you've completed all these tasks, raise a PR with your work so far. Don't wait to complete your coursework before completing the PR.

## Stretch 💪

Try the stretch tasks after you've completed the other sections.
