### Notes

+ i need to make a method that takes a two sets of numbers 5 digits each. it must sort each i descending order then find the the difference between the first two number in the set e.g. difference between data set 1 index i and data set 2 index i, add the difference to a count var, print the result of the count var 

here is a example of the input data that will be tested. each pair will need to have a return value from the method so we can write a test file in jest to help with testing and printing to screen so the build looks like:
